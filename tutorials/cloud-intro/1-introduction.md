# Realm Cloud

The Realm Cloud is the fastest and easiest way to get started synchronizing data between your apps.

You got a server now, but since there is no data yet in the server, letâ€™s use realm-js to create a sample data set.

To complete this step, you will need to sign up for our Professional Edition trial [here](https://realm.io/trial/realm-professional-edition/).

A token will be emailed to you that you can use in the sample application.
