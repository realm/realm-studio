# Release 3.0.5 (2018-11-13)

[Changes since v3.0.4](https://github.com/realm/realm-studio/compare/v3.0.4...v3.0.5)

# Enhancements
- None

# Bugfixes
- The getting started scene of the server administration window was missing a button for the React Native quick start guide and the iOS and Android URLs was rendering 404 errors. This was fixed by adding the button and updating the URLs. (#963)
- On the server administrations Realm tab, a query-based partial or reference Realm had a path-level permissions block, which was confusing because path-level permissions are not enforced by the server for these Realms. This was fixed by removing the list of path-level permissions for these types of Realms. (#989)
- Windows was getting smaller on the Windows OS each time the window was opened. This was fixed by enforcing a lower bound on the window height when restoring it from the previous state. (#991)
